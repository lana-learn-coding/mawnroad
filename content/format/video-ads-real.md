Outstream video ads are a form of video advertising that appears outside of traditional video content. Unlike instream
ads, which play before, during, or after a video, outstream ads are standalone video units embedded within non-video
environments such as articles, blogs, and social media feeds. They typically auto-play when they come into view and
pause if the user scrolls past, ensuring a seamless browsing experience.

#### Key Features of Outstream Video Ads

1. **Non-Intrusive Experience**: Outstream ads integrate smoothly into the user experience, appearing in natural breaks
   within the content. This reduces the likelihood of disrupting the user’s journey.

2. **Flexible Placement**: These ads can be placed in various locations, such as between paragraphs of text, in
   sidebars, or within scrolling feeds, allowing advertisers to reach audiences in diverse contexts.

3. **Cost Efficiency**: Since outstream ads don’t require hosting within a video, they are often more cost-effective and
   accessible for brands that don’t produce their own video content.

4. **Engagement Metrics**: Outstream ads often come with advanced engagement tracking, enabling advertisers to measure
   viewability, interactions, and completions more effectively.

#### Benefits of Outstream Video Ads

- **Expanded Reach**: By appearing on websites and platforms that don’t traditionally host video content, outstream ads
  help brands reach a broader audience.
- **Higher Viewability**: These ads are designed to only play when in view, ensuring that impressions are meaningful.
- **Improved Brand Recall**: Video content naturally captures attention, making outstream ads an excellent tool for
  increasing brand awareness and recall.
- **Better Control Over Ad Placement**: Advertisers can choose specific contexts and environments where their ads
  appear, aligning with the brand’s messaging and target audience.

#### Best Practices for Creating Effective Outstream Video Ads

1. **Keep It Short and Sweet**: Attention spans are short, so aim for a video length of 15-30 seconds.
2. **Optimize for Mobile**: With the majority of users accessing content on their smartphones, ensure your video is
   mobile-friendly.
3. **Engage Early**: Capture attention within the first few seconds with compelling visuals or a strong hook.
4. **Add Subtitles**: Many users watch videos with the sound off, so subtitles can help convey your message effectively.
5. **Test and Iterate**: Use A/B testing to evaluate what resonates best with your audience and refine your strategy
   accordingly.
