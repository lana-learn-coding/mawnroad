man with no secrets to hide.__ *No, I did not kill Kitty.* However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's
questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.

## It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you.

Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Steve Holt! I'm a monster. That's why you always leave a note!

1. I care deeply for nature.
2. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life.
3. That's why you always leave a note!

### I'm afraid I just blue myself.

Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Well, what do you expect, mother? I don't understand the question, and I

Really? Did nothing cancel? I'm afraid I just blue myself. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. No, I did not kill
Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets
to hide.

First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. That's why you
always leave a note! I'm a monster.

I've opened a door here that I regret. I'm afraid I just blue myself. Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time!
Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer.

There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. I don't criticize you!
And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right.

I'm afraid I just blue myself. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. Army had half a day. There's so many poorly

meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.

Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Whoa, this guy's straight? Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. I'm
