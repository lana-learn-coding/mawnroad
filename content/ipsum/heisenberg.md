# Cook It!

You're his cook now. You're the cook and you have proven that you can run a lab without me and now that cook has reason
to kill me. Think about it! It's brilliant. So go ahead. If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go ahead.
Put a bullet, in my head, and kill me right now. DO IT! Do it. Do it. Do it.

Saul, Saul... this man that we spoke of before, this... this person that you said could... could disappear me, get me a
whole new life and make sure that I'm never found. Yeah I need him, Saul. Gus is gonna murder my whole family. I need
this man now. Saul... now, Saul!

Anything suspicious? Well... then should we go? Any uh... Cartel news these days? Seems like I'm always reading
something or other in the paper. I don't want to talk about it. To you or anyone else. I'm done explaining myself. Gus
is dead. We've got work to do.

Jesse Jackson? Do you even... ah, I see you have a telephone at least. You know that blinking thing I've been calling
you on? I will break this, I will BREAK THIS. Damn druggie idiot. Is this what you've been doing the whole time I've
been trying to reach you?
