# We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!

Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots.
How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Soothe us with sweet lies. Fatal. A sexy mistake.

__lso Zoidberg.__ *Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the
reception isn't very… One hundred dollars.* Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his
own Oscar.

## And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.

And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? We'll need to have a look inside you with
this camera. You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

1. Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!
2. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?
3. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

### And I'm his friend Jesus.

Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. We don't have a brig. I could if you hadn't turned on the
light and shut off my stereo. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

* The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of
  cards. Checkmate.
* I can explain. It's very valuable.
* Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.

Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! OK, if
everyone's finished being stupid. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right.

Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of
cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… Can we have Bender Burgers again?

Noooooo! You're going to do his laundry? I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm
going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks.
Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You don't know how to do any of those. Does anybody else feel jealous
and aroused and worried? I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!

Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? No argument
here. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will '
destroy' you! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help
me with my sexual inhibitions?

Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Guess again. Why would I
want to know that? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day
to go. The toilet.

You don't know how to do any of those. Guess again. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Ummm…to eBay?
Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Kids have
names? Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Oh, I always feared he might run off like
this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a
hat. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.

In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults
whom I killed for their stemcells. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets
are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.
